## Ecommerce-website was developed using React project template with ASP.NET Core
ASP.NET Core with React installation tutorial:

```
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/client-side/spa/react?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=visual-studio
```
after installation, cd to Ecommerce-website and run the program with the following command:
```
dotnet run
```
the program is now hosted at address:
```
http://localhost:5000
```
To run the frontend independently
```
cd ClientApp
npm start
```
For running the app from Visual Studio:
```
Open the generated ecommerce.csproj file, and run the app as normal from there.
The build process restores npm dependencies on the first run, which can take several minutes. Subsequent builds are much faster.
```
